Convert Webpages to EPUB3 - cli and library

Download and convert a webpage to a [EPUB3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-33/) format.

Why?

* We / You / I need to save AI pages for analysis
* HTML alone does not save images, stylesheets and so forth
* PDF destroys document structure and imposes unneeded and meangingless page breaks
* EPUB3 is a single file (all assets zipped) with a well defined format

Inspired by Will Crichton's [Portable E](https://willcrichton.net/notes/portable-epubs/).
